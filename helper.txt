# Reset Remote Repository for Harmoniapy v1.2.0

This guide will help you overwrite your existing remote repository with the current v1.2.0 code, making this the first commit on the remote.

## Overwrite Remote Repository History

1. Create an orphan branch (branch with no history):
```bash
# Create new branch with no history
git checkout --orphan temp-branch

# Add all files to the new branch
git add .

# Commit with new version message
git commit -m "Harmoniapy v1.2.0: Complete rewrite with improved performance"
```

2. Delete main branch locally and recreate it from your temporary branch:
```bash
# Save your work to temporary branch
git branch -m temp-branch v1.2.0-clean

# Delete the local main branch and recreate it
git branch -D main
git checkout -b main
git merge v1.2.0-clean --allow-unrelated-histories
```

3. Force push to overwrite remote repository:
```bash
# Force push to overwrite remote history
git push origin main --force
```

4. Clean up:
```bash
# Remove temporary branch
git branch -D v1.2.0-clean
```

## PyPI Upload Instructions

1. Make sure you have the build and twine packages installed:
```bash
pip install --upgrade build twine
```

2. Build your package:
```bash
python -m build
```

3. Upload to TestPyPI first (recommended):
```bash
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

4. Test your package from TestPyPI:
```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ harmoniapy

python -m twine upload dist/*
```
